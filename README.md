# Information System of Barangay 684

**Introduction**

The goal of our project includes developing a local system that makes it simple for
captains and staff to easily access personal information of residents for government purposes.
The implementation of a secure login system is significant to the access levels for citizens
and barangay officials. 

It also includes an effective resident management system in the
portal to aid in handling and monitoring the progress of the resident’s information. An
integrated master list section will allow the captain and his assigned administrator to manage
residents’ crucial information to keep the community updated.

The chosen client in this project is from barangay 684 Zone 74 located in the National
Capital Region (NCR). In the community, the life of residents is simple and productive,
enabling the fostering of social relationships. They ensure that participation in the community, as well
as the safety, incorporates huge development of the barangay. Moreover, the lack of digital
presence in barangay needs to be solved to have a better system for the community.
A local system has been introduced to Barangay 684 to address this kind of problem.
The local system can serve as the guide in details of resident’s information. The residents
would benefit from these improvements as they can save time and at the same time incorporate
comfort in the barangay.
